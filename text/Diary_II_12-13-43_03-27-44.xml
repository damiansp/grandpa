    <line><entryHeader>Dec 13</entryHeader> Off with a bang! Bo Bo</line>
    <line>had us all out in the dirt at 9:30 to</line>
    <line>tear our rifles down.  All any</line>
    <line>soldier is supposed to do to his</line>
    <line>rifle is field strip it.  If he does</line>
    <line>more[,] it's his personal loss if a part</line>
    <line>is broken.  Every soldier is taught</line>
    <line>that from his first week[,] yet Bo Bo</line>
    <line>had us out to completely tear them</line>
    <line>down.  I was further griped when</line>
    <line>I got there + there was only one screw[-]</line>
    <line>driver for 80 men.  6 could work + 74</line>
    <line>wait.  One of my men asked me</line>
    <line>if he was supposed to use a screw[-]</line>
    <line>driver on his rifle.  I told him I</line>
    <line>was always taught differently {but}</line>
    <line>that I {wrote} my kid brother to do</line>
    <line>the opposite of what he was</line>
    <line>told and he'd be the best overseas</line>
    <line>man in his outfit if he were a</line>
    <line>bit unpopular with the brass</line>
  </page>
  <page number="2">
    <line>I then commented that when I got home</line>
    <line>I'd put my rifle on a pedestal in the</line>
    <line>yard + let it rust till it fell apart.  Then</line>
    <line>Bo Bo remarked that talk wouldn't get</line>
    <line>the rifle apart so for me to get</line>
    <line>going on mine.  When I asked him if</line>
    <line>I were to use my thumb nail for a</line>
    <line>screwdriver he blew his top + told</line>
    <line>me to go hunt one.  I was well</line>
    <line>pleased at that + told him I'd be</line>
    <line>back as soon as I found one.  I</line>
    <line>left and am not back yet.  I met</line>
    <line>him on the bridge 10 minutes later and</line>
    <line>he promised me there'd be a new Pvt. in</line>
    <line>the outfit if I again made such remark.  I</line>
    <line>told him if the order weren't inconsistent</line>
    <line>the answer would have been different.  He</line>
    <line>said go up + borrow the screwdriver.</line>
    <line>I asked him if the order were cancelled</line>
    <line>to hunt one that that was what I was</line>
    <line>doing.  He then said go on + hunt one.</line>

    <line>Before noon we had an air raid alarm.</line>
    <line>One recruit was sounding alert + another</line>
    <line>alarm.  I got half in the hole + half</line>
    <line>out + waited patiently.  All clear came</line>
    <line>an hour later.  We saw no planes</line>
    <line>but could hear guns firing at them.</line>
    <line>I can see now that this book is started</line>
    <line>upside down but re-starting at the other</line>
    <line>cover would be admitting defeat so I'll continue.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 14</entryHeader> And still things continue to</line>
    <line>be a little less monotonous.  A</line>
    <line>shipment of red gasoline came in</line>
    <line>+ Salhoff is losing weight in anticipation</line>
    <line>of the frequent burner cleanings.  I was</line>
    <line>planning on making a few points by</line>
    <line>recommending saving the white for</line>
    <line>lanterns but Seabiscuit beat me to</line>
    <line>it.  Well Seabiscuit saw me</line>
    <line>making some twisted bread so</line>
    <line>maybe I got a few there.  6 ovens</line>
    <line>were thrown back.  Had an</line>
  </page>
  <page number="4">
    <line>air raid alert when we were all</line>
    <line>through but 3 ovens.  For once I</line>
    <line>expected the real thing but it was</line>
    <line>another dry run.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 15</entryHeader> During last night's air raid</line>
    <line>the Sgt. of the guard (Phelps)</line>
    <line>was gone to the show by Joe</line>
    <line>E. Brown.  It would never have</line>
    <line>been known except for said</line>
    <line>raid[,] but he's been in hot</line>
    <line>water all day.  The field marshall</line>
    <line>is especially hot on his trail.</line>
    <line>All the E. M. were called but</line>
    <line>the officers slept.  Rations</line>
    <line>came in + I parted with my</line>
    <line>{brew/men}.  Canteen cup disappeared</line>
    <line>last night[,] but I found it before</line>
    <line>too long.  Red gas gives trouble.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 16</entryHeader> Found out by observation how</line>
    <line>native climbs palm trees.  Put both</line>
    <line>feet thru a small loop and by</line>
  </page>
  <page number="5">
    <line>twisting outward with ankles put</line>
    <line>enough pressure against tree with</line>
    <line>balls of feet to prevent slipping.</line>
    <line>This particular one was after Betel</line>
    <line>nut.  Had a discussion with Heft</line>
    <line>about condition of bakery.  As the</line>
    <line>saying goes[,] a man convinced against</line>
    <line>his will is of the same opinion still</line>
    <line>but at any rate[,] the sponge cans were</line>
    <line>left clean for the first time.  New</line>
    <line>rule excuses 1st 3 grades from short</line>
    <line>arm inspections {which} we had one</line>
    <line>today.  Wrote a letter to be posted</line>
    <line>on board + signed Melvin D.  He's in</line>
    <line>water (Hot) still over the air raid {deal}</line>
    <line>and now he's got mixed up and</line>
    <line>put a girlfriend's and wife's letters in</line>
    <line>the wrong envelopes + Mrs. Phelps</line>
    <line>is waiting with the rolling pin.</line>
    <line>Primmer drew me a picture of</line>
    <line>Melvin behind bars.  Very Good.</line>

    <line><entryHeader>Dec 13</entryHeader>Couldn't sleep after breakfast</line>
    <line>so I sat on the river bank to</line>
    <line>keep warm + read "Pemberton</line>
    <line>defender of Vicksburg".  Meeting in</line>
    <line>mess hall at 10:30 about egg frying,</line>
    <line>lights + sockets[,] + air raid precautions.</line>
    <line>Big lottery in P.M. to determine which</line>
    <line>24 men out of 36 get sweaters.</line>
    <line>Phelps removed letter from board.</line>
    <line>
      <entryHeader>Dec 18</entryHeader> Seabiscuit went to the hospital
    </line>
    <line>with malaria so I had a peaceful</line>
    <line>day.  Truck goes to {Chabon} tomorrow</line>
    <line>to take my boys on a pleasure trip.</line>
    <line>I intended to stay here + go to church</line>
    <line>+ ball game but after supper</line>
    <line>{Comhoff} came around with orders</line>
    <line>for me to be with 1st Platoon</line>
    <line>or D.S. for a few weeks.  If my</line>
    <line>platoon leaves[,] I'm to come back.</line>
    <line>I don't see the point + {Comhoff} played</line>
    <line>dumb. Platoon does not need</line>
    <line>2 S/Sgts.</line>

  <page number="7">
    <line>
      <entryHeader>Dec 19</entryHeader>Moved to {Chabour} about {half}
    </line>
    <line>my boys made the trip + I {believe}</line>
    <line>one of them brought Levine a note</line>
    <line>from Bo Bo. By talking with Johnston</line>
    <line>I've come to the conclusion Bo Bo</line>
    <line>wants me busted but lacks the</line>
    <line>nerve to do it.  Knowing I never liked</line>
    <line>Levine + vice versa[,] he thinks he</line>
    <line>will soon bust me.  Then he will</line>
    <line>have accomplishe his end at</line>
    <line>no risk of the ill will of my</line>
    <line>boys.  {Gouger} thinks Seabiscuit</line>
    <line>wants {Primm} for a S/Sgt +</line>
    <line>will pull out with my platoon</line>
    <line>+ leave me here.  Comhoff says</line>
    <line>I'll go back if they leave[,] but</line>
    <line>none of our officers are above</line>
    <line>lying.  Bo Bo will be very</line>
    <line>perplexed if the Hebrew + I get</line>
    <line>along.  Saw Baptist church</line>
    <line>near {Tensooki}.</line>
  </page>
  <page number="8">
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 20</entryHeader> Johnston asked me if I'd</line>
    <line>mind working on the bench.  I took</line>
    <line>ovens in preference to get away</line>
    <line>from flour dust.  Jimmy hated</line>
    <line>to ask me to work but of course</line>
    <line>it was The Hebrew's idea.  Fact</line>
    <line>is[,] I'd much rather work than</line>
    <line>idle about.  Steak is (I mean was)</line>
    <line>for supper.  First since the States.</line>
    <line>Show "Mr. Big" after supper.</line>
    <line>I've seen it before but enjoyed</line>
    <line>it more this time.  First show I've</line>
    <line>watched in peace since Kilmer.</line>
    <line>This place is O.K.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 21</entryHeader>Worked ovens again with</line>
    <line>{less} work than yesterday.  Was</line>
    <line>plenty out of practice.  Nothing</line>
    <line>more eventful during the AM</line>
    <line>than accidentally hitting The</line>
    <line>Hebrew with the hook.  We</line>
    <line>drew 86 rounds of ammunition.</line>  
  </page>
  <page number="9">
    <line>I wasn't here when it was called</line>
    <line>for[,] but I got Clearey's.  The</line>
    <line>Hebrew found Gouger[']s cap in</line>
    <line>a sponge can + threw it</line>
    <line>away.  Also[,] he threw a fit about</line>
    <line>a fitting on a burner being broken.</line>
    <line>While Ramsey was gone to get it</line>
    <line>fixed[,] Scala chopped the burner itself</line>
    <line>+ broke the manifold.  Hebrew will</line>
    <line>be in a huff tomorrow.  No</line>
    <line>one bothers me here.  The Hebrew</line>
    <line>passes by + says nothing out of</line>
    <line>the way.  I could stay here + like</line>
    <line>it.  All that I dislike is the</line>
    <line>idea of someone else possibly</line>
    <line>getting my platoon.  I made it</line>
    <line>and dislike someone else coasting</line>
    <line>with it + getting the credit.  Of</line>
    <line>course[,] I never get credit for it</line>
  </page>
  <page number="10">
    <line>being an excellent platoon[,] but</line>
    <line>I know the why's if Bo Bo +</line>
    <line>the others don't.  Because I'm a</line>
    <line>friend of the boys[,] he thinks I'm</line>
    <line>not their leader.  Fact is[,] I am their</line>
    <line>leader rather than driver[,] but</line>
    <line>he thinks if a fellow doesn't</line>
    <line>throw his rank around[,] he isn't</line>
    <line>on the ball.  If he'd ever</line>
    <line>contacted men in anything but</line>
    <line>a soliciting manner he'd know</line>
    <line>the score a little better.</line>
    <line>An Indian[,] {Criapracter} sp? was</line>
    <line>just in + showed me a trick.  By</line>
    <line>pulling a leader under the {arms}</line>
    <line>he gets a sensation of electricity</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 22</entryHeader> The Hebrew said that</line>
    <line>some of the bread is black</line>
    <line>+ some is not done.  I said</line>
    <line>nothing.  The reason is the</line>
    <line>antiquated ovens (1914)[,] but</line>
  </page>
  <page number="11">
    <line>he knows that.  We were</line>
    <line>all disappointed when he</line>
    <line>saw the broken burner +</line>
    <line>thought it was an old</line>
    <line>break.  Comhoff, Wolfe +</line>
    <line>Muller came + brought us</line>
    <line>a little mail[,] but the</line>
    <line>purpose of their trip was</line>
    <line>to get some whiskey.  Not</line>
    <line>wishing them any hard luck</line>
    <line>I hope they get some with</line>
    <line>wood alcohol in it.  Show</line>
    <line>again tonight "Destry Rides Again."</line>
    <line>Got a letter from {Blanner}</line>
    <line>today.  Was in a state room</line>
    <line>on the boat with him.  I</line>
    <line>answered it today also.  It took</line>
    <line>it 5 weeks to get here from</line>
    <line>elsewhere in India as a</line>
    <line>as a result of my having my</line>
    <line>unit off the address at</line>
  </page>
  <page number="12">
    <line>the instructions of Lt. Comhoff.</line>
    <line>I didn't cramp my style too</line>
    <line>much when answering.  A week</line>
    <line>ago I'd have written different</line>
    <line>with Comhoff {censoring} than</line>
    <line>with Levine but I now know</line>
    <line>Comhoff betrays the trust of</line>
    <line>men who write as if the</line>
    <line>mail were not censored.  One</line>
    <line>who would do that would</line>
    <line>have to get on a ladder</line>
    <line>to look a snake in the eye.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 23</entryHeader> Big production of raisin</line>
    <line>bread for Xmas consumption.</line>
    <line>I was supposed to go to work</line>
    <line>at 6:30 but wasn't awakened</line>
    <line>till 7:00.  The Hebrew was</line>
    <line>happy all day[,] partly for</line>
    <line>the reason that he was</line>
    <line>able to start the truck when</line>
    <line>Ramsey failed.  Johnston</line>
  </page>
  <page number="13">
    <line>ran the oven named Bo Bo which[,]</line>
    <line>of course[,] is the sorriest one</line>
    <line>of the 5.  The brick structure</line>
    <line>in which irons is [[sic]] heated fell</line>
    <line>down.  Maybe it will be</line>
    <line>moved.  At present it is next to</line>
    <line>the 1st oven + puts out a</line>
    <line>great fog of smoke every time</line>
    <line>I'm down at that oven.  Also</line>
    <line>despite the fact that there</line>
    <line>are 4 ways the wind could</line>
    <line>blow[,] it always does blow</line>
    <line>from the fire (coal) toward</line>
    <line>me.  Donahue got his head busted.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 24</entryHeader> Lots of bread again today[,]</line>
    <line>but thinking how much more</line>
    <line>work I'd be doing preparatory to</line>
    <line>Xmas if I were in the civilian</line>
    <line>shop[,] I felt like I was on the</line>
    <line>gravy train.  Felt better yet</line>
    <line>when I got through the day</line>
  </page>
  <page number="14">
    <line>without a burn.  Hebrew</line>
    <line>went up + got some mail.  Said</line>
    <line>he didn't know if they sent</line>
    <line>mine down or not.  "Why not[?]" I</line>
    <line>wanted to know as they no</line>
    <line>doubt know where I am.  The</line>
    <line>equipment is all in now[,] so could</line>
    <line>be I'll go to Burma soon.  I hope.</line>
    <line>Had a bull session with</line>
    <line>Miller + astonished him by</line>
    <line>knowing where the Waldensian Bky.</line>

    <line><entryHeader>Dec 25</entryHeader> What a Christmas.  Took</line>
    <line>a ride up to the company +</line>
    <line>was glad to see the boys.  Had</line>
    <line>a flat + ran out of gas going.</line>
    <line>Muller made {Tech + Primm}</line>
    <line>Staff.  I've known Muller</line>
    <line>would get it ever since June</line>
    <line>+ so has Bo Bo[,] but he's made</line>
    <line>a big pretense of careful</line>
  </page>
  <page number="15">
    <line>consideration.  Primm is worth</line>
    <line>Staff but has been underhand</line>
    <line>with Tex.  He asks Tex confidentially</line>
    <line>about something + Tex tells him.  Then</line>
    <line>Primm goes + tells Seabiscuit what</line>
    <line>"he" thinks.  When they really</line>
    <line>want to know something[,] they ask</line>
    <line>Tex[,] but from now on he</line>
    <line>"won't know."  I got neither</line>
    <line>letter nor package which is about</line>
    <line>what I expected.  We had a Xmas</line>
    <line>program here after supper.</line>
    <line>Primm has Muller's platoon.  I</line>
    <line>hope he keeps it.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 26</entryHeader> We were over one hour late</line>
    <line>on the baking today[,] mostly</line>
    <line>because the boys were up</line>
    <line>late last night.  There was a</line>
    <line>lot of good[-]natured kidding</line>
    <line>between Johnston + I about</line>
    <line>the tech Sgt.  I helped him</line>

  <page number="16">
    <line>figure out next week[']s work</line>

    <line>duty will save either Willis or I</line>
    <line>operating 3 ovens + 2 is all a</line>

    <line>After supper[,] Shorty Evans from</line>
    <line>another outfit came in with</line>
    <line>his guitar + sang + played</line>
    <line>Between numbers[,] I made the</line>
    <line>announcement advertising Crazy</line>
    <line>Crystals, {Kolorbak}, etc. as</line>
    <line>much like a borderline</line>

    <line>but it's prohibited anyway.</line>
    <line>He also made a few comments</line>
    <line>about Bo Bo.  All the equipment</line>
    <line>is in but he refuses to let</line>
    <line>the boys here have mixers.</line>
    <line>The boys do the back[-]breaking</line>
    <line>job by hand as a result of</line>
    <line>Bo Bo wanting to display his</line>

    <line>use the equipment up there.</line>
    <line>I saw it Xmas sitting in</line>
    <line>storage but[,] higher brass</line>
    <line>says it can't come here</line>
    <line>if they need it there so</line>
    <line>Bo Bo lies about it for</line>
    <line>the satisfaction of his ego.</line>

    <line>when even the man's fellow</line>

    <line><entryHeader>Dec 21</entryHeader> Had a new oven crew with</line>
    <line>the exception of myself.  Johnston</line>
    <line>+ I had a talk.  He expects</line>
    <line>Primm to end up with my</line>
    <line>platoon.  Levine told him what</line>
    <line>I suspected[,] that Bo Bo sent me</line>
    <line>down here for him to reduce</line>
    <line>but he's refused to do it.  He</line>

    <line>be no longer a part of the 111th.</line>
    <line>It would probably be that I'd</line>
