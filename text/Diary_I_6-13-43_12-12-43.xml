    <line>After I had been in</line>
    <line>this army about a month</line>
    <line>it first occurred to me</line>
    <line>that a diary from my first</line>
    <line>day should have been kept</line>
    <line>but since it hadn't[,] I let it</line>
    <line>go[,] assuming that the first</line>
    <line>month was likely the most</line>
    <line>interesting anyway.  Six months</line>
    <line>later I could see that lots of</line>
    <line>interest had happened and that</line>
    <line>I should have started even</line>
    <line>a month late, but as before,</line>
    <line>I figured the first few</line>
    <line>months were doubtless</line>
    <line>the most eventful and that</line>
    <line>a diary of such a late start</line>
    <line>would be dull.  When</line>
  </page>
  <page number="2">
    <line>at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey I</line>
    <line>once again considered the</line>
    <line>matter + resolved to start</line>
    <line>a diary from the day we</line>
    <line>embarked but could not</line>
    <line>find suitable notebook</line>
    <line>at the P.X.<super>1</super> and we were</line>
    <line>confined to the post.  Soon</line>
    <line>afterwards I was told that</line>
    <line>diarys [sic] overseas were not</line>
    <line>permitted so I dismissed</line>
    <line>the idea when in Camp</line>
    <line>Anza<super>2</super>, California.  Now at</line>
    <line>the camp located around</line>
    <line>Ledo in the province of</line>
    <line>Assam in India the</line>

    <line>summary of the first 20</line>

    <line>In January 1942, I hitch[-]hiked</line>
    <line>to Fayetteville[[, Arkansas]] to the recruiting</line>
    <line>office and took my physical.</line>
    <line>I was slightly afraid I'd flunk</line>
    <line>it due to sub-par eyesight.</line>
    <line>Little did I realize that seeing</line>
    <line>the wall on which the chart</line>
    <line>hung would have been</line>
    <line>good enough.  After the exam</line>
    <line>I returned home for two</line>
    <line>weeks thinking Frank<super>1</super> would</line>
    <line>be home on furlough.  There</line>
    <line>again one could see my innocence</line>
    <line>so far as the army goes.  I actually</line>
    <line>believed he would get a furlough</line>
    <line>because one of his officers had</line>
    <line>promised it him.  Feb. 5th I left</line>
    <line>Harrison[[, Arkansas]], again hitch hiking, and</line>
    <line>went to the office in Fayetteville</line>

    <line>off leaving dirt to become India's</line>
    <line>leading mud hole when the</line>
    <line>monsoons come.  The alleged</line>
  </page>
  <page number="76">
    <line>reason was that mosquitos abound in</line>
    <line>grass.  Today we started putting sod</line>
    <line>down.  No doubt the mosquitos will</line>
    <line>take the first project as a hint</line>
    <line>they're not wanted + will be too</line>
    <line>independent to come back.  The report</line>
    <line>came in today that the Japs used gas</line>
    <line>at Chunking.  Field Marshal issued</line>
    <line>order for boys baking to bring masks</line>
    <line>to bakery.  If we're gassed[,] the quickest</line>
    <line>+ only possible way it could brought</line>
    <line>is by plane.  We get the air alarm</line>
    <line>at least 15 minutes early.  Then the</line>
    <line>boys have time to go to <i>bashas</i> +</line>
    <line>get steel + rifle.  It looks to me</line>
    <line>like they could get their masks at</line>
    <line>the same time but the Field Marshal</line>
    <line>outranks me so evidently I'm</line>
    <line>mistaken.  This A. M. I heard the</line>
    <line>sound of something that sounded like</line>
  </page>
  <page number="77">
    <line>a bull to me[,] but it was over the</line>
    <line>bank of the river where no bull</line>
    <line>would go.  I told Mora (Guard) to</line>
    <line>bring his rifle + maybe we'll find</line>
    <line>something to shoot.  It was an</line>
    <line>elephant + had 3 natives on his back.</line>
    <line><entryHeader>Dec 2</entryHeader>  Brewer died today.  I first</line>
    <line>met him on the train <i>en route</i></line>
    <line>to A. I. B. from Camp Lee.  He'd</line>
    <line>been with me ever since + he had</line>
    <line>been with me longer than any</line>
    <line>man in the company.  Now I'm the</line>
    <line>only one of the original 9 who came</line>
    <line>from Lee.  Only 4 of the 9 are here now[:]</line>
    <line>Bruno, Timmy, Muller, + I.  Was</line>
    <line>over to him 3 days ago + he</line>
    <line>seemed in pretty good spirits[,] but I</line>
    <line>told Pete he'd never get well.  Maier[,]</line>
    <line>Ramp + I almost chased a "Sacred</line>

  <page number="78">
    <line>balancing on the edge + if Wolfe had</line>
    <line>only pushed when I yelled[,] there</line>
    <line>would have been a mighty splash.</line>
    <line>It was my ambition to be able to</line>
    <line>go back to the States saying I'd eaten</line>
    <line>a steak off a sacred cow from the</line>
    <line>day I found I was coming to India.</line>
    <line>That ambition was fulfilled Nov 11</line>
    <line>but now I want to commit a</line>
    <line>greater outrage + chase one into</line>
    <line>the river.  The time will come.</line>
    <line>The Field Marshal has evidently come</line>
    <line>to the conclusion that what this</line>
    <line>company needs is fuller utilization of</line>
    <line>manpower.  Today <u>one</u> man was</line>
    <line>driving <u>two</u> trucks.  {Utter} would</line>
    <line>drive the big truck up to be loaded</line>
    <line>with dirt.  Then walk + get the</line>
    <line>weapons carrier + take it up to</line>
    <line>be filled with sod.  Then walk</line>
  </page>
  <page number="79">
    <line>over to the big truck + drive it down</line>
    <line>to be unloaded etc. For such a</line>
    <line>display of initiative The Field Marshal</line>
    <line>should be decorated but I guess mention</line>
    <line>in this book is all he'll get.</line>
    <line>The Mess Sgt. is lamenting in a loud</line>
    <line>voice. There was a Chinaman here</line>
    <line>today buying cigarettes.  He couldn't</line>
    <line>speak or understand a word of English.</line>
    <line>He was up to the kitchen dealing with</line>
    <line>Tyler.  Bo Bo rimmed Tyler severely</line>
    <line>for having him around.  Tyler said</line>
    <line>he couldn't help it whereas Bo Bo</line>
    <line>said "The Chinaman told me you told</line>
    <line>him to come."  Tyler can't figure out</line>
    <line>how he told Bo Bo anything when he</line>
    <line>doesn't speak English.  He even suspects</line>
    <line>our C. O. of stretching the truth[,] but to</line>
    <line>quote him[,] "What's a fellow gonna do[?]"</line>
    <line>It beats me.</line>

    <line><entryHeader>Dec 3</entryHeader>  What a cheerful day!  Early</line>
    <line>this morning there was a wreck on</line>
    <line>the Margarita Bridge.  The bridge is</line>
    <line>primarily a R. R. bridge but it</line>
    <line>has been floored + used by trucks</line>
    <line>+ trains alike.  It works pretty good as</line>
    <line>a rule[,] but this morning both were</line>
    <line>trying to use it at the same time.</line>
    <line>A train met 6 trucks on it.  The</line>
    <line>driver of the first truck spotted the</line>
    <line>train + tried to beat it.  He just</line>
    <line>got off + the train hit his truck</line>
    <line>on the rear end.  He wasn't hurt.  The</line>
    <line>next 5 were all piled up.  Motors +</line>
    <line>other parts flew in all directions.</line>
    <line>Some of them caught fire + I thought</line>
    <line>the trestle would burn down.  The</line>
    <line>train was loaded with Chinese</line>
    <line>Cavalry + one of the trucks was</line>
    <line>loaded with Gooks.  As best I can</line>
  </page>
  <page number="81">
    <line>find out[,] the dead were 5 American</line>
    <line>soldiers, 22 Goooks, + at least 1</line>
    <line>Chinaman.  The scrambled Gooks</line>
    <line>were all over the bridge, on the</line>
    <line>sand bar, + in the river.  The</line>
    <line>latter were picked up in a few</line>
    <line>boats.  Bruno + I sat on the bank of</line>
    <line>the river + could see it all.  This</line>
    <line>afternoon we buried Brewer up in</line>
    <line>the tea plantation.  It was pretty</line>
    <line>impressive.  The whole company, his</line>
    <line>buddies for the duration, stood with</line>
    <line>heads uncovered during the prayer,</line>
    <line>the Scripture reading, the sounding of</line>
    <line>taps, + the firing of the rifles.  Some</line>
    <line>Indians stood nearby + no doubt thought</line>
    <line>it strange procedure.  One woman, a</line>
    <line>nurse, was present.  All around was</line>
    <line>green grass + then acre after acre</line>
    <line>of tea, beautifully green + smooth.</line>
  </page>
  <page number="82">
    <line>In the distance was the mountains,</line>
    <line>range after range with the snow</line>
    <line>caps in the far distance plainly</line>
    <line>visible.  India is a miserable country</line>
    <line>but Earl is buried in a beautiful</line>
    <line>though lonely spot.  When we came</line>
    <line>over[,] no man expected us to all go</line>
    <line>back[,] yet each man felt sure <u>he</u></line>
    <line>would.  It all helps a man to realize</line>
    <line>the insignificance of the individual.</line>
    <line>Like the rest[,] I feel certain I'll again set</line>
    <line>foot on the U. S. + live a long +</line>
    <line>happy life.  God willing[,] I shall.</line>
    <line>
      <entryHeader>Dec 4</entryHeader>  Nothing out of the ordinary happened
    </line>
    <line>till noon.  We had spam, mashed</line>
    <line>potatoes, + gravy which seemed to me</line>
    <line>to be a little better than common.</line>
    <line>I sat down + as I put the third</line>
    <line>bite in my mouth[,] a husky looking</line>
    <line>worm dropped off the ceiling and</line>
  </page>
  <page number="83">
    <line>landed with a splash flat of [[on]] his</line>
    <line>back in the gravy in my mess kit.</line>
    <line>After a brief flailing of many legs</line>
    <line>he submerged.  I took him out +</line>
    <line>dumped him in the G. I. can + then[,]</line>
    <line>not to be outdone[,] I went back for</line>
    <line>seconds + ate them without mishap.</line>
    <line>Afternoon Bruno + I went to Margherita</line>
    <line>+ looked around.  What a dump.  Bought</line>
    <line>a shoulder patch + pen + will stay</line>

    <line>First time since we got to India.  We</line>
    <line>had memorial services in the mess</line>
    <line>hall for Brewer.  Bo Bo said a few</line>
    <line>words.  Of course he didn't say the</line>
    <line>right words but he was so touched</line>
    <line>that for once I felt sorry for him.</line>
    <line>I never feel malice toward him</line>
    <line>but usually my sympathy runs</line>
    <line>to the unfortunate Jr. officers +</line>
    <line>E. M. in his command.  After</line>
    <line>dark the Ramp came by the bakery</line>
    <line>and informed me that he'd spotted a</line>
    <line>wild bull which we should</line>
    <line>be able to chase in the river.  As</line>
    <line>we pursued the bull around</line>
    <line>Sloppy Bottoms (Officers' Quarters)</line>
    <line>he suddenly came upon the</line>
    <line>fence which Bo Bo had built</line>
    <line>around their yard last week.</line>
  </page>
  <page number="85">
    <line>Bo Bo was right proud of that fence</line>
    <line>but today it is in need of repair as</line>
    <line>the bull ran right thru it + didn't</line>
    <line>even look back to see how big</line>
    <line>a gap he left.  Eventually we did</line>
    <line>get the bull in the river + I got</line>
    <line>enough mud on my shoes to</line>
    <line>supply 328 mud dobbers the entire</line>
    <line>season.  The latest event was a</line>
    <line>crazy nigger escaped from the hosp.</line>
    <line>At about 10 P. M. he came up to our</line>
    <line>fire in his pajamas.  We called</line>
    <line>the hospital but he left before they</line>
    <line>came after him + nigger was</line>
    <line>still at large at quitting time.  If</line>
    <line>Bo Bo had been awake I'd have told</line>
